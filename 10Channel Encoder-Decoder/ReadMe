# Channel Encoder-Decoder
In this section I uploaded some codes for Channel Encoders and decoders.
These codes used in my projects. I will change them when I find the better one.
Now you can find some Matlab and CUDA codes for channels blocks but it will extend to C++, Python and other languages.

This roadMap section you can see what I will import to this folder which I have implemented in these years. I should import them to my account, but it needs time and support.
I will check whenever each part will be completed.

## Roadmap

- [x] LDPC Decoder:
  - [ ] CUDA code (in General)
  - [ ] CUDA code for DVBS2
- [x] TPC Decoder:
  - [ ] CUDA code
- [ ] Reed Solomon Decoder:
  - [ ] Matlab Code
  - [ ] CUDA Code

- [ ] Viterbi Decoder
    - [ ] C++
    - [ ] Matlab
